# üîó Articulation Points for Super Node Detection

> **Identify critical bridge nodes that artificially connect unrelated data clusters**

## üìñ What Are Articulation Points?

Articulation points are nodes whose removal would **disconnect parts of your graph**. In data networks, these critical nodes often reveal data quality issues rather than genuine relationships.

### Real Example
```
Cluster A (100 customers) ‚Üê‚Üí [test@test.com] ‚Üê‚Üí Cluster B (200 customers)
                                     ‚Üë
                            ARTICULATION POINT
                          (removal splits graph)
```

When a single email, phone, or SSN connects unrelated customer groups, it's typically **dirty data** - not a real connection.

## üéØ Why This Matters for Data Quality

### The Problem with Traditional Approaches

| Approach | What It Finds | Reality |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **High Degree Nodes** | Most connected nodes | Often just dirty data |
| **Community Detection** | Customer clusters | Misses bridge nodes |
| **Pattern Matching** | Known data patterns | Can't adapt to new issues |

### What Articulation Points Reveal

| Type | Description | Example | Action |
|------|-------------|---------|--------|
| üóëÔ∏è **Dirty Data** | Placeholder values bridging clusters | `test@test.com` | Exclude |
| ‚úÖ **Legitimate** | Real shared services | Corporate phone | Monitor |
| üö® **Anomaly** | Unusual identity patterns | Duplicate SSN | Investigate |

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Graph Projection

> üìù **Note:** Relationships must be UNDIRECTED for articulation point detection

```cypher
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'customerArticulationGraph',
    // Include all relevant node types
    ['Customer', 'Email', 'Phone', 'SSN'],
    // Project relationships as undirected for connectivity analysis
    {
        HAS_EMAIL: {orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'},
        HAS_PHONE: {orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'}, 
        HAS_SSN: {orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'}
    }
);
```

### Step 2: Run Detection Algorithm

```cypher
CALL gds.articulationPoints.write('customerArticulationGraph', { 
    writeProperty: 'articulationPoint'
})
YIELD articulationPointCount;
```

‚úÖ **Expected Output:** Typically 50-200 articulation points in a million-node graph

### Step 3: Analyze Detected Super Nodes

#### üìß Email Super Nodes
```cypher
MATCH (e:Email)
WHERE e.articulationPoint = 1
WITH e, COUNT { (e)<-[:HAS_EMAIL]-() } AS connections
RETURN 
    e.address AS Address,
    connections AS ConnectedCustomers,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.address CONTAINS 'test' THEN 'üóëÔ∏è Test Data'
        WHEN e.address STARTS WITH 'no' THEN 'üóëÔ∏è Placeholder'
        WHEN connections > 3 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious'
        ELSE '‚úÖ Review'
    END AS Classification
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### üì± Phone Super Nodes
```cypher
MATCH (p:Phone)
WHERE p.articulationPoint = 1
WITH p, COUNT { (p)<-[:HAS_PHONE]-() } AS connections
RETURN 
    p.phoneNumber AS PhoneNumber,
    connections AS ConnectedCustomers,
    CASE 
        WHEN p.phoneNumber CONTAINS '000' THEN 'üóëÔ∏è Default'
        WHEN p.phoneNumber CONTAINS '999' THEN 'üóëÔ∏è Test'
        WHEN connections > 3 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è Investigate'
        ELSE '‚úÖ Legitimate'
    END AS Classification
ORDER BY connections DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
